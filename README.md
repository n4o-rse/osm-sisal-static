# osm-sisal-static

A static, read-only Wikibase (GitHub Pages) for OpenStreetMap elements: the cave entrances (`natural=cave_entrance`) of OpenStreetMap that belong to SISAL speleothem sites (a fixed list of 221 node IDs from osm2lod).
It is built with [wikibase-static](https://github.com/n4o-rse/wikibase-static) and follows the site
[osm-benchmarks-static](https://github.com/n4o-rse/osm-benchmarks-static), whose model it takes over unchanged.

Each OSM element becomes one item with one QID, as OSM itself knows only one ID per element. The
element's version history is tracked as statements on that item, and every item is anchored on
a CIDOC CRM class: `crm:E26 Physical Feature` (proposal, see PRIMER.md). The geometry of each version is kept as WKT, so the model also carries ways and relations.

**State (S1, S2):** the skeleton and the model (the class “Cave”, the fourteen properties of the benchmarks site) are in place; there are no data yet. The first harvest is step S4 (221 nodes, 219 of them returned in the osm2lod run of 2026-03-28); the link to the SISAL sites is step S5 and needs a decision first (PRIMER.md, part D). The work plan, the decisions made so far and the steps ahead are in [`PRIMER.md`](PRIMER.md) (German).

## Build

Needs Python 3.10 or later. In a Windows `cmd` window, in this folder:

    pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py --strict

`python main.py --list` shows the steps. `python main.py import-osm --probe` sends one Overpass request and writes nothing (it asks for the selection `sisal` by itself).
`update.cmd` installs the current `wikibase-static` again, builds with `--strict`, and commits and pushes
only if something changed.
